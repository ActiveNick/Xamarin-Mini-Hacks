We invite you to join the Xamarin Evolve 2014 Mini-Hacks challenge: a fast, easy, and fun way to explore native mobile development with Xamarin. Each mini-hack consists of a small programming challenge involving a specific set of APIs or a particular third-party programming framework. 

Mini-hacks are designed to stimulate developers of all skill levelsâ€”each challenge comes with step-by-step instructions to guide you if you get stuck. You can find all of the challenges in this GitHub repository.

To get started, click one of the mini-hacks below and attempt to complete the challenge that is described in the included README file.
