![Evolve 2013 Mini-Hacks](header.png)

We invite you to join the Evolve Mini-Hacks challenge: a fast, easy, and fun way to explore mobile development with Xamarin. Each mini-hack consists of a small programming challenge involving a specific set of APIs or a particular third-party programming framework. 

Attendees at Xamarin Evolve 2013 can show their completed hacks to a Xamarin staffer in the Darwin Lounge to collect stickers. Evolve attendees who collect four stickers on their conference badge will receive a Xamarin Power Pack.

Mini-hacks are designed to stimulate developers of all skill levels—each challenge comes with step-by-step instructions (and a working sample) to guide you if you get stuck. You can find all of the challenges, working samples, and step-by-step guides in this GitHub repository.

To get started, click one of the mini-hacks below and attempt  to complete the challenge that is described in the included README file.
